# Twitch Streams Code
This repo stores all of the code I create during streaming. For each stream, I'll create a branch and then merge it into `trunk` at the end and push both. That should keep things from getting too messy should. Hopefully it's useful üòé

All of the streams are also available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_kRIqFHtN8ccB_mTmHyGDg) but are uploaded after the stream.
